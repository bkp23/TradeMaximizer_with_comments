1) Look at unmatched receivers
  a. Mark each want's sender to be evaluated
  [b. if no one else wanted me want last time, enable self-match]
2) Look at each sender to be evaluated
  a. if unmatched, propose as matching candidate (with recv that wants it)
  b. if matched, evaluate the matched receiver per bullet #1
  [c. if there's no one to send to me, self-match]

A matched receiver is only evaluated if an unmatched receiver wants the same thing.

A sender is only evaluated if an unmatched receiver wants it.

Anything that's not evaluated gets a high price for next round.
So a high-priced sender:
  a) Has no unmatched receivers wanting it
  b) Becomes a candidate to match itself
A high-prices receiver:
  a) Wants something no one else does (no unmatched receiver does)
